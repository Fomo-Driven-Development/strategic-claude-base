# [Feature/Task Name] Implementation Plan

## Overview

[Brief description of what we're implementing and why]

## Current State Analysis

[What exists now, what's missing, key constraints discovered]

## Desired End State

[A Specification of the desired end state after this plan is complete, and how to verify it]

### Key Discoveries:

- [Important finding with file:line reference]
- [Pattern to follow]
- [Constraint to work within]

## What We're NOT Doing

[Explicitly list out-of-scope items to prevent scope creep]

## Implementation Approach

[High-level strategy and reasoning]

## Phase 1: [Descriptive Name]

### Overview

[What this phase accomplishes]

### Changes Required:

#### 1. [Component/File Group]

**File**: `path/to/file.ext`
**Changes**: [Summary of changes]

```[language]
// Specific code to add/modify
```

### Success Criteria:

#### Automated Verification:

- [ ] Code compiles/builds successfully: `[build command]`
- [ ] Type checking passes: `npm run typecheck`
- [ ] Linting passes: `make lint`
- [ ] Migration applies cleanly: `make migrate` (if applicable)

#### Manual Verification:

- [ ] Feature implementation matches specification
- [ ] Integration points connect as designed
- [ ] No build or deployment errors
- [ ] Ready for testing (see related test plan)
