# [Feature/Task Name] Test Plan

## Overview

[Brief description of what we're testing and the testing approach]

## Implementation Plan Reference

**Related Implementation Plan**: `.strategic-claude-basic/plan/PLAN_[NNNN]_[date]_[subject].md`

[Brief summary of what the implementation plan covers]

## Current Test Coverage Analysis

[Assessment of existing tests, gaps in coverage, testing infrastructure state]

## Test Strategy

### Test Types Required:

- **Unit Tests**: [Components/functions to unit test]
- **Integration Tests**: [System interactions to test]
- **End-to-End Tests**: [User workflows to test]
- **Performance Tests**: [Load/stress testing requirements]
- **Security Tests**: [Security validation requirements]

### Testing Approach:

[High-level strategy for test implementation]

## What We're NOT Testing

[Explicitly list out-of-scope testing areas to prevent scope creep]

## Phase 1: [Test Type/Area]

### Overview

[What this test phase accomplishes]

### Test Coverage Requirements:

#### 1. [Component/Feature Group]

**Files Under Test**: `path/to/file.ext`
**Test File**: `path/to/test/file_test.ext`

**Test Cases**:

```[language]
// Example test structure
describe('[Component Name]', () => {
  test('should [behavior]', () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
});
```

**Coverage Requirements**:

- [ ] Happy path scenarios
- [ ] Edge cases and error conditions
- [ ] Input validation
- [ ] Error handling

### Test Data and Fixtures:

**Test Data Requirements**:

- [Data setup needed]
- [Fixture files to create]
- [Mock data patterns]

**Test Environment Setup**:

- [Database setup/teardown]
- [External service mocking]
- [Configuration requirements]

### Success Criteria:

#### Automated Verification:

- [ ] Test suite runs successfully: `[test command]`
- [ ] Coverage threshold met: `[coverage command]`
- [ ] No test flakiness: `[stability test command]`
- [ ] Tests pass in CI environment: `[ci test command]`

#### Manual Verification:

- [ ] Tests accurately validate expected behavior
- [ ] Edge cases are properly covered
- [ ] Test output is clear and actionable
- [ ] Test execution time is acceptable

## Phase 2: [Test Type/Area]

### Overview

[What this test phase accomplishes]

### Integration Test Strategy:

#### 1. [System Integration Point]

**Integration Scope**: [What systems/components are being tested together]
**Test Scenarios**:

- [Scenario 1: Normal operation]
- [Scenario 2: Error conditions]
- [Scenario 3: Edge cases]

**Mock Strategy**:

- [External services to mock]
- [Internal components to stub]
- [Data sources to simulate]

### Success Criteria:

#### Automated Verification:

- [ ] Integration tests pass: `[integration test command]`
- [ ] System interactions validated: `[system test command]`
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met: `[performance test command]`

#### Manual Verification:

- [ ] End-to-end workflows function correctly
- [ ] Error scenarios handled gracefully
- [ ] System performance is acceptable under load

- **Coverage Reporting**: [Coverage tools and thresholds]

### CI/CD Integration:

- **Test Execution**: [When and how tests run in CI]
- **Coverage Reports**: [Where coverage is reported]
- **Test Result Artifacts**: [What artifacts are preserved]
- **Failure Notifications**: [How failures are communicated]

## Test Data Management

### Test Data Strategy:

- **Data Generation**: [How test data is created]
- **Data Cleanup**: [How test data is cleaned up]
- **Data Isolation**: [How tests avoid interfering with each other]
- **Sensitive Data Handling**: [How sensitive data is managed in tests]

### Fixtures and Mocks:

- **Static Fixtures**: [Files/data that don't change]
- **Dynamic Fixtures**: [Data generated per test run]
- **External Service Mocks**: [Third-party service simulation]
- **Database Mocks**: [Database interaction simulation]

## Performance and Load Testing

### Performance Requirements:

- [Response time requirements]
- [Throughput requirements]
- [Resource usage limits]
- [Scalability targets]

### Load Testing Strategy:

- **Load Scenarios**: [Different load patterns to test]
- **Stress Testing**: [Breaking point identification]
- **Endurance Testing**: [Long-running stability]
- **Spike Testing**: [Sudden load increase handling]

## Security Testing

### Security Test Requirements:

- **Input Validation**: [Malicious input handling]
- **Authentication**: [Auth mechanism validation]
- **Authorization**: [Permission enforcement]
- **Data Protection**: [Sensitive data handling]

### Security Test Approach:
